			<p>Make sure your taxes are done and then come hang out and celebrate our relationship with us. The ceremony kicks everything off, and things end with the reception in Tempe. We are trying to keep the party going and will try to go out after. So try to think of somewhere fun you'd like to go -- we're open to suggestions.</p>

			<p>Of course, you don't have to do everything on the list. If you can only make it for one thing or the other, please feel free to let us know. We're just happy to have you. One more thing to keep in mind is that since we are still a ways out, specific times are subject to change.</p>
